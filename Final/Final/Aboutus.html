<body>Here at Gamedownload, we strive to allow our userbase make informed decisions about their purchases. Unless you are to go out and
	 play the game at a friend's house, there are no websites currently available that will allow people on PCs to play a game that
	 they are interested in without paying for it. And many of those sites have either very difficult to use, or no return/refund
	 policies, meaning that once you buy, that's money you'll never see again, regardless of whether or not you like your purchase.
	 Unlike those other sites, Gamedownload has worked with publishers to allow users to download a demo version of a game, so that
	 they may decide whether or not they'd be willing to pay for the full version of the game. That way, our users are happy, and 
	 they do not need to worry about making a bad purchase based off of nothing more than a description, some still images, and maybe 
	 a video of the product.</body>
