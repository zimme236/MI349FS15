	This is is a very delicious dip recipe that I found while watching television once. It was made by Alton Brown, and has livened 
	up many of my otherwise bland party food layouts. The recipe is as follows:
	
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>


<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 pound onions, diced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups sour cream</li>
<li>3/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper, freshly ground</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
Place the oil, onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.
Place the remaining ingredients and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium mixing bowl, add the cooled onions and stir to combine.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and stir again before serving.
