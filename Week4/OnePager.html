<h1>GameDownload.net</h1>

<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>

<p>Short Pitch:
GameDownload.net is a website designed around downloading all sorts of games from all across the decades.</p>

<p>Long Pitch:
At GameDownload.net, we’ll be focused on allowing people to download plethoras of different games from all types of publishers,
from all generations! At GameDownload.net, users will have the ability to download a small (5-15 minute) demo of a game for free
before deciding whether or not they wish to purchase it. This would set us apart from any competitor's, where you either buy it
or you don’t, and all you have to judge a game’s worth is a few videos, screenshots, and reviews, all of which can be of
questionable reliability.
